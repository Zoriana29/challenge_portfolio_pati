# Task: 1 Software configuration #
### Subtask: 1 Why did I choose to participate in the challenge portfolio? ###
Hello! My name is Zoriana. I am looking for any opportunity for professional growth. 
It is very important for me to be fulfilled and always develop myself. 
I enjoy the moment when after a long study I succeed and when the project I am working on helps people.
My goals are to learn new things and get a great job with the opportunity to grow, share knowledge and travel.
I expect from the project a productive study that will help me in the future.

### Thank you! ###
